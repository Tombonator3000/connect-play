## 2026-01-19: Player Death Mechanic & Game Over States

### Tasks
1. Implement player death mechanic (HP = 0 triggers game over)
2. Win state and loss state ("finis")
3. Doom tracker = 0 triggers game over
4. Mythos phase text overlay when clicking "End Round"

### Implementation Plan
- Create `GameOverOverlay.tsx` component for win/loss states
- Create `MythosPhaseOverlay.tsx` for phase transition
- Add game over checks in `ShadowsGame.tsx`

- [x] Added game over logic
- [x] Testing and committing

### Files Modified
- `src/game/components/GameOverOverlay.tsx` (NEW)
- `src/game/components/MythosPhaseOverlay.tsx` (NEW)

## 2026-01-19: Expanded Tile System & Location Descriptions

### Tasks
1. Expand `INDOOR_LOCATIONS` array with diverse thematic tiles
2. Expand `OUTDOOR_LOCATIONS` array with diverse thematic tiles
3. Add RPG-style descriptions for all tiles shown when player lands on them

### Implementation

#### Expanded INDOOR_LOCATIONS (75+ tiles)
Organized by category from game_design_bible.md:
- **FACADE**: Blackwood Mansion, Crumbling Church, The Gilded Hotel, The Witch House, Funeral Parlor, etc.
- **FOYER**: Grand Foyer, Marble Lobby, Cobwebbed Vestibule, Asylum Reception, etc.
- **CORRIDOR**: Dusty Corridor, Servants Passage, Cell Block Corridor, Portrait Gallery, etc.
- **ROOM**: Private Study, Séance Parlor, Dissection Theater, Padded Cell, Records Room, etc.
- **STAIRS**: Grand Staircase, Spiral Stairs, Bell Tower Steps, Hidden Stairwell, etc.
- **BASEMENT**: Wine Cellar, Flooded Basement, Smugglers Cache, Catacombs Entrance, etc.
- **CRYPT**: Sacrificial Altar, Eldritch Portal, Star Chamber, The Black Pool, etc.

#### Expanded OUTDOOR_LOCATIONS (65+ tiles)
Organized by category:
- **NATURE**: Moonlit Clearing, Treacherous Marsh, Ancient Stone Circle, Dead Mans Hollow, etc.
- **URBAN**: Arkham Harbor, Fish Market, Gallows Hill, Founders Plaza, Cannery Row, etc.
- **STREET**: Shadowy Alley, Sewer Grate, Lamplit Avenue, Dead End, The Narrows, etc.
- **SPECIAL**: Suicide Cliff, The Gibbet, Flooded Quarry, The Execution Ground, etc.

#### Location Descriptions (150+ Lovecraftian descriptions)
Every tile now has an atmospheric RPG-style description that displays when the player enters:
- Written in Lovecraftian horror style
- Second-person perspective ("You see...", "Your footsteps...")
- Atmospheric details hinting at cosmic horror
- Sensory details (sounds, smells, temperatures)
- Subtle warnings and unsettling observations

### Files Modified
- `src/game/constants.ts` (MODIFIED)
  - Expanded `INDOOR_LOCATIONS` array
  - Expanded `OUTDOOR_LOCATIONS` array
  - Massively expanded `LOCATION_DESCRIPTIONS` record

### Examples of New Descriptions

**The Witch House:**
> "The angles are wrong here. Corners that should be square are not. Your compass spins uselessly."

**Ritual Chamber:**
> "Symbols painted in substances best not examined. The air thrums with wrongness. Something was summoned here."

**Innsmouth Wharf:**
> "Decaying piers and the smell of the deep. The locals watch with bulging eyes. They're not unfriendly—just hungry."

**The Black Pool:**
> "Ink-dark water that doesn't ripple. Your reflection shows you older, changed, not entirely you anymore."

## 2026-01-19: Bug Fix - Lovecraftian Tile Descriptions Not Displayed

### Problem
The 150+ Lovecraftian tile descriptions defined in `LOCATION_DESCRIPTIONS` were never being used in the game. When players explored new tiles, only the tile name and category were logged, not the atmospheric descriptions.

### Root Cause
`LOCATION_DESCRIPTIONS` was defined in `constants.ts` but never imported or used in `ShadowsGame.tsx` where tile exploration is handled.

### Fix Applied
1. **Imported** `LOCATION_DESCRIPTIONS` in `ShadowsGame.tsx`
2. **Added** description display logic in `spawnRoom()` function
3. When a new tile is explored, the atmospheric description is now logged to the Field Journal

### Files Modified
- `src/game/ShadowsGame.tsx` (MODIFIED)
  - Added `LOCATION_DESCRIPTIONS` to imports
  - Added description lookup and logging in `spawnRoom()` function

### Result
Now when players explore tiles, they will see the full Lovecraftian description in the Field Journal:
```
[12:38:59] UTFORSKET: The Witch House. [FACADE]
[12:38:59] The angles are wrong here. Corners that should be square are not. Your compass spins uselessly.
```

## 2026-01-19: Scenario System & Legacy System Design

### Oppgave
Design og implementering av:
1. **Scenario-system** - Hero Quest + Mansions of Madness + roguelite med klare mål
2. **Legacy-system** - Bruk figurer videre mellom scenarier, shop for utstyr

### Kontekst
Spillet er inspirert av:
- **Hero Quest** - Enkle, klare regler og mål
- **Mansions of Madness** - Cthulhu-utforskning, atmosfære
- **ADOM/Roguelite** - Prosedyregenerert, hvert spill er unikt

### Analyse av eksisterende system
- `Scenario` interface finnes med `victoryType`, `steps`, `doomEvents`
- Tre scenarier definert men victory conditions ikke implementert
- `MERCHANT` fase definert men ikke brukt
- Ingen persistens mellom scenarier (legacy)

### Status
- [x] Design scenario-system
- [ ] Design legacy-system
- [x] Implementer ScenarioBriefingPopup
- [x] Implementer victory condition checking
- [ ] Implementer legacy character persistence
